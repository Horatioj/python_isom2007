So far, the output of our programs has been displayed on the screen and 
eventually lost. In most real-life applications, we want the output to 
be preserved in files in permanent storage that will be available for 
later use. Word processors and spreadsheets are two types of programs 
whose output must be preserved and accessed at a later time.
